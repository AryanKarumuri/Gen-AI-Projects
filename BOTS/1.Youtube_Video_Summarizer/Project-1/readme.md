## Code Walkthrough

### Key Components

1. **`extract_video_transcript(youtube_link)`**:
   - Loads the YouTube video transcript in chunks using `YoutubeLoader` from `langchain_community`.
   - The transcript is loaded in 30-second chunks, translated into English if necessary, and concatenated into a full transcript.

2. **`model_output(input_text)`**:
   - Takes the full transcript text as input and sends it to the Google Gemini model.
   - Uses a pre-defined prompt to instruct the model to summarize the transcript into bullet points under 250 words.

3. **Streamlit UI**:
   - A simple interface is created using Streamlit where users can input a YouTube video URL.
   - Displays the video thumbnail and generates the summary when the "Get Detailed Notes" button is clicked.

### How It Works
- The user provides a YouTube video URL.
- The application extracts the videoâ€™s transcript.
- It then interacts with the Gemini model to generate a concise summary of the video.
- Finally, the summary is displayed in a user-friendly format.

## Customization
- You can change the chunk size for transcript extraction or adjust the language preferences.
- Modify the `prompt` string to change the type or style of summaries generated by the Gemini model.
  
## Example Usage
1. **Input**:  
   - YouTube video URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=examplevideo`
2. **Output**:
   - A list of key takeaways in bullet points summarizing the main ideas of the video.

**Note:** Please ensure that you don't share sensitive API keys in public repositories. Always use secret management techniques for production applications.
