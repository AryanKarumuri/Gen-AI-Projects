It\\'s an extension of the scaled dot-product attention mechanism.\\n\\nIn traditional attention, the attention weights are computed by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors, and then applying a scaling factor and a softmax function to get the final weights.\\n\\nMulti-head attention, on the other hand, linearly projects the query, key, and value vectors into multiple subspaces (or \"heads\") of dimensionality `dk`, `dk`, and `dv` respectively, where `h` is the number of heads. Each head computes attention weights independently, and the final output is a weighted sum of all the heads.\\n\\nThis allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. The intuition behind multi-head attention is that different heads can focus on different aspects of the input, and the model can learn to combine these different aspects to form a more robust representation.\\n\\nMulti-head attention has been shown to improve the performance of transformer models in various tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and question answering.'}"
