# AI Agents

This directory explores various AI agent frameworks and their implementations. AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous software entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. This section will cover different frameworks and approaches to building and working with AI agents.

## Prerequisites First!

Before diving into specific agent frameworks, it's highly recommended to understand the fundamental concepts in the `Prerequisites` directory:

### 1. Asynchronous Programming
Located in `Prerequisites/Async/`:
- `1. basics.ipynb`: Foundation of async programming in Python
- `2. sync_vs_async.ipynb`: Comparison between synchronous and asynchronous approaches

Understanding async programming is crucial as most modern AI agent frameworks utilize asynchronous operations for efficient communication and task handling.

### 2. Data Validation with Pydantic
Located in `Prerequisites/Pydantic/`:
- `main.ipynb`: Introduction to Pydantic for data validation and settings management

Pydantic is extensively used in agent frameworks for configuration management and data validation.

## Agent Frameworks

### Current Implementations

1. **AutoGen** (Microsoft)
   - Location: `/Autogen`
   - A framework for building multi-agent systems with LLMs
   - Includes examples of basic usage, customization, and advanced features
   - See the dedicated README in the AutoGen directory for specific details

### Coming Soon
This directory will be expanded to include other popular agent frameworks such as:
- LangChain Agents
- Langgraph
- CrewAI
- SmolAgents
- And more...

## Getting Started

1. Start with the prerequisites:
   - Complete the async programming tutorials
   - Work through the Pydantic examples
   - These foundations will make it easier to understand and work with any agent framework

2. Choose a framework:
   - Each framework will have its own directory with examples and documentation
   - Follow the specific setup instructions in each framework's directory


## Note

Each agent framework has its own strengths and ideal use cases. As you explore different frameworks, you'll discover which ones are best suited for your specific needs. The prerequisites covered in this directory will help you better understand and work with any of these frameworks.

Feel free to start with any framework after completing the prerequisites.
