    "#### What is OpenRouter?\n",
    "OpenRouter is essentially a model routing API that lets developers and users interact with multiple LLMs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta‚Äôs LLaMA, and others) using a common interface ‚Äî often compatible with OpenAI‚Äôs API format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easier to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test and compare different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use models from various companies without managing separate APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize costs or performance by routing traffic intelligently."

    "#### Key Features\n",
    "- Multi-Model Access: You can choose from a wide range of models including GPT-4, Claude, Mixtral, LLaMA, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI-Compatible API: Most endpoints mimic OpenAI's API, allowing easy integration with existing tools or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pay-As-You-Go or Bring-Your-Own-Key: Some models can be used via OpenRouter's billing, while others allow you to use your own API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web Playground: A web-based UI where you can chat with different models directly for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Routing Logic: Developers can build logic to route prompts to the most appropriate model based on cost, speed, or performance."
