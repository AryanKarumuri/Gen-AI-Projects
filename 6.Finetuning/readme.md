# Fine-Tuning Modelsü§ñ

This repository provides scripts and instructions for fine-tuning various pre-trained models on custom datasets. Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a large general dataset) to a specific task using a smaller, domain-specific dataset.

## Workflowüõ†Ô∏è

1. **Choose a Pre-trained Model**: Select a model suitable for your task (e.g., BERT for text classification, ResNet for image classification).
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Prepare your dataset (tokenization for text, resizing for images).
3. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Replace the final layers (if needed) and train the model on your data.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Monitor performance on a validation set, and fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.

## Prerequisites‚öôÔ∏è

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers (for NLP tasks)
- CUDA for GPU acceleration
- IPEX for XPU acceleration

## Best Practicesüí°

- Use a **small learning rate** when starting.
- **Monitor validation loss** to avoid overfitting.
- Use **data augmentation** for better generalization, especially in computer vision tasks.
- **Use early stopping** to prevent overfitting and stop training when the model performance stops improving.
- **Using a GPU** makes the work easier and significantly speeds up the fine-tuning process. Make sure your system has enough **RAM** to handle large models and datasets.

## üìö Available Fine-Tuned Models

- **Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** - Fine-tuned for **Question-Answering** tasks.
