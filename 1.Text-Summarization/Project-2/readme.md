# Summarization using Hugging Face Pipeline

This is a basic example of text summarization using the Hugging Face pipeline.

## How It Works

This script uses the Hugging Face pipeline for summarization, which is powered by a pre-trained transformer model such as BART, T5, or GPT-3. These models are fine-tuned on large datasets and can generate coherent summaries of long texts.

In this example, the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model is used for the summarization task.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverages Hugging Face's pre-trained models for efficient text summarization.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive API to summarize text using the Hugging Face pipeline.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable model types and summarization parameters, such as `max_length` and `min_length`.

## Customization

You can further customize the pipeline by:

- Using different summarization models available on Hugging Face, such as `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, `t5-small`, and others.
- Adjusting the `max_length` and `min_length` parameters to control the size of the output summary.
- Fine-tuning models on your own dataset if needed to tailor the summarization to specific use cases.
